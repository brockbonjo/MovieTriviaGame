Basic Pseudocode:

Upon opening the page, the player will be prompted with the instructions 
    and rules of the game.
The game starts by asking the player to press a button. 
    This button will initialize the game.
The player will have 10 seconds to answer each question.
Each question will ask the player where the famous movie quote is from.
When the player answers the question correctly, the clip from that movie will play.
    If the player guesses wrong, the clip from Willy Wonka plays "https://media.giphy.com/media/ARj2OMThsPoAw/giphy.gif"


Pseudocode:

On open screen display in HTML the rules of the game and a button. 
The functionality in JavaScript of the button will start the game 
and open an object where a movie quote will be displayed and four 
buttons will show answers to which movie the movie quote belongs. 
This object contains the movie quote, 4 buttons containing the potential 
answers to the questions, and the http for the movie quote on YouTube 
if the correct button is clicked.


When the button displaying the correct answer is chosen, it will turn 
green and a video will fade in that shows the movie clip that was included 
in that object for the question.  


The video (string) that will play when an incorrect button is clicked will be 
a global variable. The other three buttons containing the wrong answers 
will contain clickHandlers that triggers the YouTube video 
that plays the clip from Willy wonka. I will be playing both videos 
this way, however, the video linked to the correct answer will be a 
part of the object for that question.
